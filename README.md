## Getting Started

After [downloading this example](https://github.com/graphcool-examples/react-relay-instagram-example/archive/master.zip) please follow these steps.

### 1. Create an account

To run this example, please create a [Graphcool](http://graph.cool) account and **copy your endpoint**. This shouldn't take longer than a minute. We promise!

### 2. Configure app data and build schema endpoint

Open `package.json` and replace `https://api.graph.cool/relay/v1/__PROJECT_ID__` with your endpoint in the following line:

```js
    "start": "GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=${GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT:=https://api.graph.cool/relay/v1/__PROJECT_ID__} webpack-dev-server -d --hot --inline --history-api-fallback --no-info --port 3000",
```

This step is needed in order to support Relay. More info can be found here: [babel-plugin-react-relay](https://github.com/graphcool/babel-plugin-react-relay).

### 3. Run the example

You're done configuring the example application. Please run the following command and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. Have fun exploring! ðŸŽ‰

```sh
yarn && yarn start
# or npm install && npm start
```

## Deploy the example

Instead of running the app locally, you can also deploy it to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). Keep your **project endpoint** ready!

```sh
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy
```

or click the deploy button to see it live.
